Hello, dear visitor, it's the first really serious project on python that i've worked on. Survive 'em all is an arcade platform game with a simple concept. 
At the moment the game is still raw due to lack of time, so I'll be glad if you advice me in which direction to work in future. 
Thanks for attention.

Quick usage instructions
========================
To play the game you should just install required libraries and run the main file.
